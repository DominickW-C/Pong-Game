This is a project I did in between my freshman and sophmore year of college.
I had very little JavaScript Expirience going into it and used this as a way
to familiarize myself with the language. It is also one of my first expiriences
using graphics in a program.

As of making my first commit there are a few bugs: 
    - AI is glitchy and bounces back and forth 
    - it does not like keys pressed simultaneously

And I would like to add something that would ask you if you are playing single
player or multiplayer.

This code is not optimized, unsure of if I have plans to optimize it in the 
future as it was a test for working with JS and graphics
